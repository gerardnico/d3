# Treemap Leaves Representation with Div element


## Introduction
This script uses D3 (v4) to show a tree with:
  * a CSV
  * through HTML Div element
  
The Csv file must contains two columns:
  * id where the tree structure is embedded in the name through a separator (for now a Windows \\)
  * value
The headers must be without space as they becomes properties that have a meaning for D3.

There is no idea of drill down into the hierarchy.
